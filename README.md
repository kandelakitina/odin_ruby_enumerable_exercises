# Ruby Enumerables

A custom implementation of Ruby's Enumerable methods, designed to mimic the behavior of Ruby's built-in iterators and enumerables.

## Purpose

This project is created as a learning exercise to understand how Ruby's Enumerable module works under the hood. It includes custom methods that replicate the functionality of Ruby's native methods such as `each`, `map`, `select`, `none?`, `inject`, `count`, `any?`, and `all?`

## Features

- Reimplementation of Ruby's Enumerable methods
- Straightforward and educational code
- Useful for understanding iteration and internal mechanics of Ruby collections

## Usage

(You can add usage examples here if applicable)

## Contributing
